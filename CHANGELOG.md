# Changelog

All notable changes to jonobones are recorded here. Each release entry has two
parts:

- **Highlights** — a 2-3 sentence "what's new" paragraph generated at release
  time by an Anthropic-API call (see `scripts/generate_changelog.py`).
- **Categorized changes** — a list of merged commits since the previous tag,
  grouped by [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) prefix,
  produced by [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/) using `cliff.toml`.

The release workflow on every tag push regenerates both, commits the new section
here, and uses the same content as the GitHub Release body.

<!--
  Keep-a-Changelog ordering: [Unreleased] at the top, then newest released
  version, then older versions. generate_changelog.py inserts new
  "## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD" sections directly below [Unreleased].
  Don't remove the marker.
